## What is Pomodoro Timer?

Pomodoro Timer is a customizable timer that works on both desktop and mobile browsers. The goal of this app is to help you focus on any task you're working on, such as studying, writing, or coding.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique, created by Francesco Cirillo, is a productivity method designed to enhance focus and concentration. The technique involves breaking work into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
